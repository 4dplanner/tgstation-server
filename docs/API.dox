@section api_intro Introduction

The TGS4 API is designed to be a fully realized RESTful service. Once hosted, follow the specified protocol for developing new clients or one off requests that provide full control over the server

Routes and their usages are defined as follows

[I (If Instance is required)] <Http Method> "<Route>" [Request Model] => <Response Model>

@section api_lib Official Libraries

The TGS4 API's canonical definitions are provided as a .NET Standard library in the form of a nuget package located here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tgstation.Server.Api

An all inclusive TAP interface for using the API is also provided in this package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tgstation.Server.Client

@subsection api_interp Interpreting C# Models

This document will reference the canonical C# models in the Tgstation.Server.Api namespace. Note that these models are built to mirror the JSON requests and responses with a couple caveats.

- The first letter of every field name will/must be lowercase in JSON models
- Fields in the C# model marked with "DenyWrite = true" cannot be changed using POST requests
- Fields marked 'Required' should be ignored, this is a semantic for the backing SQL database
- Id fields must be specified when making POST requests
- All other fields are optional and may be absent from responses or requests unless otherwise specified

@section api_header Headers

TGS4 expects this set of headers. Failure to provide them may result in 

- User-Agent: The user agent product header value of the calling program. Should be in the form Agent/Version (i.e. SomeTgsClient/1.2.4)
- Accept: application/json
- Api: Another product header value representing the version of the API to use. Currently this must be: Tgstation.Server.Api/4.0.0.0

For POST and PUT requests you must also include the content type. Currently only json is supported

- Content-Type: application/json

For requests made to any Instance based API's a header with the Instance's ID must be provided

- Instance: The ID of the instance being accessed

An Authentication header is also required. See @ref api_auth

@section api_response Response Codes

TGS will only every return the response codes listed here

- 200: General OK status. Unless the HTTP DELETE verb was used to make the request (In which case the response body will be empty), the response body will contain a json model or array depending on the API called.
- 400: Bad request made. The response body will contain a @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.ErrorMessage model detailing the error
- 401: User unauthorized. Invalid or expired credentials were provided. Check rights APIs for updates. See @ref api_auth for details
- 403: Usage forbidden. User tried to make a request they were not allowed to perform. 
- 404: Not found. A resource was requested that had never existed. In the case of retrieving a resource by ID, it could potentially exist in the future
- 406: Not acceptable. Consequence of failing to provide an Accept header
- 408: Request timeout. The client took to long to continue a request
- 409: Conflict. Documented in the requests that use them
- 410: Gone. Attempted to access/modify a resource that ideally should have been ready, but isn't or no longer is
- 419: Rate limited. Used with operations that rely on GitHub.com. If a rate limit is hit for an operation this will be returned
- 500: Server error. Please report the request and response body to the code repository
- 501: Not implemented. Currently used in two places: 1. Endpoints that trigger a server restart but the server is not running in a restartable configuration. 2.
- 503: Service unavailable. The server is either starting up or shutting down and isn't ready to respond to requests. You can try again soon and a response/lack thereof will indicate which of the two events it was

@section api_auth Authentication

Every request made to TGS requires authentication. It is provided in the form of the Authorization header. 

The first request made to TGS must be to login the user

POST "/" => Token

Headers:

- Username: <your username>
- Authorization:Password <your password>

If the provided credentials are valid and your user account is enabled you will recieve a @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.Token object
@code{.json}
{
    "bearer": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxIiwiZXhwIjoiMTUzMzIzNjk0MSIsIm5iZiI6IjE1MzMyMzYwNDEiLCJpc3MiOiJUZ3N0YXRpb24uU2VydmVyLkhvc3QiLCJhdWQiOiJUZ3N0YXRpb24uU2VydmVyLkFwaSJ9.QWFSWNi9mgol582zaK4MQ5XDK2gZF-Nx3z9_ToHjKW4"
}
@endcode

If your account is disabled, you will recieve a 403 response.

You may recognize the bearer value as a <a href="https://jwt.io">Json Web Token</a>. This is a secure representation of your identity to the server. It expires after a set period of time or until your password changes. It must be present for requests made to all other APIs. To do so add the following header to your other requests

- Authorization:Bearer <your bearer token>

Continue to use this token until you begin to recieve 401 responses from the API. Then repeat the process to get a new one if your credentials are still valid

@section api_perms Permissions

Almost all actions available require some level of user permissions. Which are divided into two categories:

- General permissions apply to a user across the entire service
- Instance permissions apply only when interacting with a specific instance

Permissions are represented a a 32 bit integer in the form of bitflags. The two endpoints for retrieving these permission are:

GET "/Users" => @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.User
I GET "/InstanceUser" => @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.InstanceUser

See individual documentation of each permission enum for their usage

@section api_user User Management

TGS start with one user action "Admin". The password is "ISolemlySwearToDeleteTheDataDirectory"

There are two types of users that can be created: Database users and system users. Database users are your plain login/password style users. System users are based on either Windows or POSIX accounts depending on the host system. They cannot be created by TGS and have to be activated by adding them to the Database similarly to a normal user using the "SystemIdentifier" field which should generally be set to their username or DOMAIN\\Username in an active directory environment. These act the same as regular users with the only exception being @ref api_config. See that section for details.

New users can be created with the following method.

PUT "/User" @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.UserUpdate => @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.User

To create a regular user, populate the name and password fields. To create a system user populate the SystemIdentifier field. Users rights and enabled status can also be specified in this call. To change them later use this API.

POST "/User" @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.UserUpdate => @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.User

Passowords for database users may be changed as well using this call. The capitalization of the display name of a user may also be changed

@subsection Instance User Management

Instance users must be created for a given instance before being manipulated. The creator of an instance starts with full permissions on it

I PUT "/InstanceUser" @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.InstanceUser => @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.InstanceUser

They can be updated with a similar POST

I POST "/InstanceUser" @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.InstanceUser => @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.InstanceUser

Unlike regular users, they can also be deleted, which prevents the user from discovering the instance

I DELETE "/InstanceUser/{UserId}" => OK

Users with the permission to modify @ref Tgstation.Server.Api.Models.Instance objects can also gain user editing rights for any Instance. See @ref api_instance
